This is an attempt at software to calculate various electronic formulas.
Mostly, the reason for existence is that I figure out this info, and then forget it and
figure it out again in the next year and the next... As I find the time or need,
I will add more features.

Pull requests are welcome.

To run this software (Linux only), run the run.sh file.

Most sane Linux distros will have Python and Gtk installed, which is all that is required.
